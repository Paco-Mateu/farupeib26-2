# FarupeIB 26 Prototype Process

## Goal

This repo is a sprint kit for building a convincing prototype in about two hours during the contest.

The kit should let us:

- start from a stable full-stack base
- keep secrets out of git
- run three prototypes in parallel without port collisions
- deploy each prototype from GitHub to Vercel
- support both end-user and professional entry points
- plug in MongoDB and OpenAI quickly once the contest idea is known

## Core Structure

- Frontend: Next.js in `app/`
- Backend: FastAPI via `api/index.py` and `backend/`
- Database: MongoDB
- AI providers: OpenAI for chat/completions, Voyage optional for embeddings and rerank
- Reserved seams: `backend/auth/` and `backend/multitenancy/`
- Static assets: `public/brand/` and `public/prototype-media/`
- Data: `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, `data/synthetic/`
- Notes and prompts: `docs/briefs/` and `prompts/`

## Route Contract

The current frontend split is:

- `/` for the event landing page / expectation page
- `/app` for the end-user or mobile-oriented portal
- `/pro` for the professional or desktop-oriented portal

| Route | Portal | Layout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Kit landing page | Teaser / QR code page |
| `/pro` | Professional (desktop) | Fixed sidebar + scrollable main |
| `/app` | End user (mobile) | Fixed `100dvh` shell + top header + bottom nav |

Important mobile assumptions for `/app`:

- fixed shell with `height: 100dvh`
- safe-area insets for notches
- bottom navigation designed for app-like movement
- `userScalable: false` in viewport metadata

## Parallel Repo Map

We are working with three repositories in parallel:

| Repo | Frontend | Backend | Database |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `farupeib26-1` | `3001` | `8001` | `proto1` |
| `farupeib26-2` | `3002` | `8002` | `proto2` |
| `farupeib26-3` | `3003` | `8003` | `proto3` |

The MongoDB cluster can stay the same across all three repos as long as the database name changes per repo.

## Secret Rules

These rules are non-negotiable:

1. Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.vercel/`, private keys, or real tokens.
2. Keep real values only in local env files and in Vercel project settings.
3. Commit only `.env.example` with placeholders.
4. Run the secret audit before push if anything sensitive changed.

Guardrails already in this repo:

- `npm run security:check`
- `npm run security:hooks`
- local git hooks in `.githooks/`
- GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/guardrails.yml`

## Environment Variables

The main variables we care about are:

```bash
PROJECT_SLOT=2
PROJECT_NAME="FarupeIB 26 Prototype 2"
BACKEND_PORT=8002
FRONTEND_PORT=3002

MONGODB_URI="<mongodb-uri>"
DATABASE_NAME=proto2

OPENAI_API_KEY="<openai-api-key>"
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL="gpt-5.4-mini"
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL="text-embedding-3-small"
VOYAGE_API_KEY="<voyage-api-key>"
VOYAGE_EMBEDDING_MODEL="voyage-4-lite"
VOYAGE_RERANK_MODEL="rerank-2.5-lite"

PUBLIC_DEMO_URL=https://farupeib26-2.vercel.app
PUBLIC_DEMO_URL_PORTAL=https://farupeib26-2.vercel.app/pro
PUBLIC_DEMO_URL_APP=https://farupeib26-2.vercel.app/app
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_URL=https://farupeib26-2.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_URL_PORTAL=https://farupeib26-2.vercel.app/pro
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_URL_APP=https://farupeib26-2.vercel.app/app
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME="FarupeIB 26 Prototype 2"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_HEADLINE="We are building this prototype live today."
NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_MESSAGE="Scan the code now, come back in two hours, and this page should feel completely different."
```

Rules for env management:

- local development uses `.env.local`
- tracked placeholders live in `.env.example`
- production and preview values live in Vercel project settings
- public variables must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- bare hostnames like `farupeib26-2.vercel.app` are normalized to `https://...` at runtime

## One-Time Setup Per Repo

Run this once inside each of `farupeib26-1`, `farupeib26-2`, and `farupeib26-3`.

```bash
npm install
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run security:hooks
```

Then create the slot-specific local env:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-slot.sh 2
```

Use `1`, `2`, or `3` depending on the repo, then fill `.env.local` with the real values.

## OpenAI Readiness

Before the contest, OpenAI must be validated so it does not fail during the build sprint.

Use:

```bash
npm run openai:check
```

That check performs:

- one tiny OpenAI chat/completions request
- one tiny OpenAI embeddings request
- failure-fast validation for missing key or missing default models

Optional Voyage check:

```bash
npm run voyage:check
```

That performs one tiny Voyage embeddings request and one tiny Voyage rerank request.

The backend also exposes:

- `GET /api/health` for cheap readiness
- `GET /api/health/openai` for live OpenAI validation
- `GET /api/health/voyage` for live Voyage validation
- `POST /api/ai/openai-check` for an explicit API runtime check

## Local Development Flow

Standard local startup:

```bash
npm run demo:start
```

Standard local shutdown:

```bash
npm run demo:stop
```

The startup script:

- starts FastAPI first
- waits for backend health
- starts Next.js
- writes logs under `logs/`
- avoids port collisions where possible

For a full local validation pass:

```bash
npm run deploy:check
```

That command verifies:

- secret audit
- OpenAI runtime
- Python compile health
- production Next.js build
- local startup
- route checks for `/`, `/app`, `/pro`, `/api/health`, and `/api/health/openai`
- Vercel build flow if the repo is linked locally

## GitHub and Vercel Structure

Recommended deployment shape:

- one GitHub repo per prototype
- one Vercel project per repo

That means:

- `farupeib26-1` -> one Vercel project
- `farupeib26-2` -> one Vercel project
- `farupeib26-3` -> one Vercel project

We are not splitting frontend and backend into separate Vercel projects unless there is a strong reason later.

## Vercel Local Linking

The Vercel link is local only and is not committed because `.vercel/` is ignored.

Per repo:

```bash
npm run vercel:link
npm run vercel:status
```

## Syncing `.env.local` to Vercel

After local linking, push the env values to Vercel:

```bash
npm run vercel:env:push
```

Pull them back if needed:

```bash
npm run vercel:env:pull:dev
npm run vercel:env:pull:preview
npm run vercel:env:pull:prod
```

By default, the sync skips local-only values:

- `PORT`
- `FRONTEND_PORT`
- `BACKEND_PORT`

## Contest-Day Runbook

Before the event:

1. Confirm MongoDB is reachable.
2. Confirm `npm run openai:check` passes.
3. Confirm `npm run deploy:check` passes.
4. Confirm the Vercel project is linked and env vars are synced.
5. Confirm the public QR URL points to the correct landing page.

When the idea is announced:

1. Write a short problem statement in `docs/briefs/`.
2. Decide whether the prototype uses public data, synthetic data, or both.
3. Drop any logo or visuals into `public/brand/`.
4. Define the first three API capabilities the prototype must demonstrate.
5. Keep the data model small and seed only what helps the demo.
6. Start with one strong user journey before expanding.

Before the final demo:

1. Re-run `npm run deploy:check`.
2. Verify `/`, `/pro`, and `/app` on the public domain.
3. Verify `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/health/openai`.
4. Confirm the QR code still points to the intended URL.

## Current Assumptions

- MongoDB is the shared persistence layer.
- OpenAI is the primary AI runtime.
- `gpt-5.4-mini` is the default chat/completions model unless we choose a stronger model for a specific prototype.
- `text-embedding-3-small` is the default embeddings model unless the prototype needs higher recall or multilingual quality.
